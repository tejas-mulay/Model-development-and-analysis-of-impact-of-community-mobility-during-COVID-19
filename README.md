# Model-development-and-analysis-of-impact-of-community-mobility-during-COVID-19

The project aims to analyse the community mobility and its repercussions on the number of cases to provide a structured guideline for restrictions and a model to follow in future pandemics. Following were the objectives of the project-

- Identifying the parameters that affect the spread of disease
- Analysing the regions affected the most during the pandemic
- Economic impact on local businesses in different regions
- Devising a structured lockdown implementation
- Impact of community mobility on variation in number of cases
- Developing a model from COVID19 to handle future outbreaks

The repository contains the following files-

1. COVID19 India Analysis.ipynb: 
   The jupyter notebook is intended to analyze the trends in the country over the tenure of 269 days. It fits a polynomial regression model and calculates the R-Square values for    different degrees, finally obtaining the optimal model. It also builds correlation among the parameters, thus analyzing the trends.
2. District-Wise Analysis.ipynb:
   The jupyter notebook is intended to analyze the trends in a particular user selected district over the tenure of 269 days. It fits a polynomial regression model and calculates    the R-Square values for different degrees, finally obtaining the optimal model. It also builds correlation among the parameters, thus analyzing the trends.
3. Enum_Final.csv:
   It is the enumerated dataset used to perform district-wise analysis.
4. Index.csv:
   It is the reference dataset for the user to input distreict and state code.
5. India.csv
   It is the averaged dataset for a partiular day used to perform nation-wide analysis.
